<p>Dear Fellow or Future Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>Do you feel like you’re working hard and putting in a lot of time but not producing any results? </p>

<p>Have the two F words of real estate, flexibility and freedom, caused chaos in your life?</p>

<p>I understand if you’re struggling in your current brokerage or you’re hungry to take the next step in your career but you don’t have the structure and guidance in place to hit your production goals.</p>

<p>The fact is, you’re not alone. In reality, 87% of real estate agents fail within their first two years in the business. They either run out of money or don’t have the support or structure needed to be successful in this business long-term. An agent needs many things in order to be successful, including training, support, coaching with accountability, structure, and leads. If you don’t have that, you’ll be ready to walk away from the industry.</p>

<p>I’ve been there before, too. I’ve worked at big-box brokerages that are void of culture, coaching, and guidance. A lot of agents in this situation try to solve this problem by spending more money to get more leads, but they don’t have the right systems in place to convert those leads. Basically, you’re a one-legged duck swimming in circles trying to find where your next lead’s going to come from. If you can’t solve this problem and you continue down this same path, you’ll go broke or end up as one of the 87%.</p>

<p>If you need a plan to get your life back, I can provide that plan. </p>

<p>We’re looking for Realtors who want to sell 25 to 50 homes and make $125,000+ per year to join our team. The Kittle Team has sold thousands of homes over the past 19 years, and we were a top-producing team at both Keller Williams and Coldwell Banker before starting Kittle Real Estate. We market our listings so well that we generate more qualified leads than we can handle. We’ve had more than 39,000 buyers in our system, and we currently have over 7,500 active buyers looking for a home to buy. With Kittle Real Estate, you’ll gain predictability in your life when you’re handed pre-qualified leads from our team structure. </p>

<p>Of course, you always have other options. You can join a big-box company like I did, and there are plenty of other brokerages out there that offer 100% commission. The thing is, though, 100% of zero sales is still zero. </p>

<p>If you join us, you’ll see how we change the lives of both our clients and our agents.
For example, one of our team members originally got in touch with us because they were losing their home to foreclosure and needed to do a short sale.  At the time, they were working as an agent for another brokerage, but after seeing how we do business, they switched companies. Not only were we able to save their home, but now that agent is making over $100,000 a year. </p>

<p>Another one of our agents came to us as a single mom who worked a full 9-to-5 job and only did real estate part-time. Once she was able to join our team and use our systems and structure, she was able to switch over to being a full-time agent. She makes over $160,000 per year.  </p>

<p>We also had one of our team members join us without having a strong resale background at all. In fact, they were in danger of missing their first mortgage payment. With our training, though, they were able to sell 45 homes in their second year. </p>

<p>As you can see, we’re offering you a way to make more money and thrive in your real estate career. You’ll be joining a company that has a history of turning out amazing agents because of our structure, culture, and training. As I said, we have more buyers than we can handle right now, so if you sign up today, we’ll have you at the closing table faster than any other brokerage in town. </p>

<p>After you join us, you’ll undergo a specifically designed 100-day training program that features the kind of one-on-one mentorship you won’t get anywhere else. </p>

<p>Nine out of 10 people who join our team make over $100,000 a year, and we’d love to show you how we do it. </p>

<p>If this sounds like something you’re interested in or you have any other questions about joining our team, just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon, and we look forward to helping you take your career in real estate to the next level.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Rob Kittle</p>
