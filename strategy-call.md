<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Rob Kittle and we've sold 5000 homes in my career.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">Kittle Real Estate was very hands on at the beginning. It was very beneficial at the beginning to gain the knowledge needed and learning the processes of real estate. Once I had a good base of knowledge, Kittle Real Estate was still there for my questions but let me take more control. I feel that it was to my advantage to take the reins since real estate success depends on how much time and effort a person puts into their business.</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">When I came to Kittle Real Estate I was a brand new agent. I interviewed 6 brokerages and Kittle stood out above and beyond all the others. From the start I knew their systems and training are superior. Before the interview they had me take a DISC profile test to learn my personality and communication style. I was impressed with their desire to seek agents that fit their team structure and identify which role within the team I would fit into. I knew that to be the best real estate agent possible for my clients I had to learn from the best. Because we are a team, I have so many people at my disposal to seek advice and direction from. They taught me the ins and outs of prospecting, how to handle objections and be genuine in my approach to help people. In my first year of real estate I sold $9,000,000+ in volume!! My first year exceeded all of my expectations. It takes hard work, proven systems and professional support to bring success. Yet, at the end of the day, you have to be willing to put in the hard work too!</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">Before Kittle Real Estate I worked with two other brokerage firms, and Kittle Real Estate has, by far, the best training. It’s not only the training that’s superior, it’s the entire support team. When you become part of the Kittle team, you are supported  by a team that has so much knowledge and experience you can’t help but be successful. The training they provide goes way beyond taking classes and reading books. They give you the opportunity to get out into the market and have real hands on experiences. Those experiences are priceless!</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">Consistent initial training on the importance of knowing our scripts, working towards LPMAMA in every conversation and tracking every lead in depth instilled the strength of my knowledge. Followed by the sharing of years of experience on how to connect with my leads, making them feel important and the desire to help them in the process of finding the home of their dreams all lead to my success as a top producing agent. The strength of every team members knowledge shared through the process of my early transactions has helped me have confidence that shows through with every client interaction.</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
